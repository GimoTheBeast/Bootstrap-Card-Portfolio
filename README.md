# Bootstrap Card Portfolio
This PHP code reads files in a folder and creates a portfolio of files used on [my website](gimotb.com)

## TODO:
- Create method of uploading on-site (manual for right now)
- Move away from requiring Bootstrap, make own base styling/format for cards
- Support multiple embed types
